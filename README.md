# gAlbumList - List Google Photo Albums

They may do no evil, but they don't get user interfaces. Google killed the wildly successful Picasa photo manager replacing it with the all-web all-the-time Google Photos. Love the auto-backups, picture identification, and all that. But now almost all the great functionality of Picasa has been lost. For many people with multiple thousands of photos lovingly curated into hundreds of albums, the one glaring omission is just a simple way to review a list of those albums.

Hence - gAlbumList - A Chrome Extension to help list out the albums in Google Photos.

## How To Use

* Download from [chrome extension store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions)
* Go to [Google Photos - Albums](https://photos.google.com/albums)
* Scroll down to bottom of page (in order to populate with all album names)
* Press extension icon button

You'll see a popup window with a list/table of all albums
* number of photos in the album
* dates of pictures in the album (as determined by google secret algorithm)
* name of album, linked to the album page

## Todo

* try to put list/table into new page; hijack photos.google.com/albums/list
* need to auto-scroll
* additional button on extension icon to goto photos.../albums
* better extension icon!
* need large extension icon (for extension settings page)
* better table - add dates as separate item / sort table
* ...
