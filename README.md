# gAlbumList - List Google Photo Albums

They may do no evil, but they don't get user interfaces. Google killed the wildly successful Picasa photo manager replacing it with the all-web all-the-time Google Photos. Love the auto-backups, picture identification, and all that. But now almost all the great functionality of Picasa has been lost. For many people with multiple thousands of photos lovingly curated into hundreds of albums, the one glaring omission is just a simple way to review a list of those albums.

Hence - gAlbumList - A Chrome Extension to help list out the albums in Google Photos.
